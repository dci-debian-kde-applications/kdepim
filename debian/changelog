kdepim (4:4.1.80+svn889885-0r1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream development snapshot.
  
  * TODO: akonadi 1.80

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Resync patches:
    - 01_branch_imap_duplication_fix.diff - remove, stolen from upstream.
    - 97_fix_target_link_libraries.diff - regenerate.
  * Bump KDE build dependencies to 4.1.80 and later.
  * Add README.source.
  * Add debian/installgen.
  * Remove explicit cmake build dependency.
  * Add new build dependencies:
    - libopensync1exp6-dev (>= 0.38);
    - libglib2.0-dev;
    - libpisock-dev;
    - libmal has been removed from Debian some time ago.
  * Binary package changes:
    - reenable kpilot;
    - disable korn;
    - remove ktnef;
    - libkabcommon4 - a common KDE address book library widely used by other
      KDE PIM packages. Add strict (=) shlibs for this library;
    - kdepim-groupwase - bundle all groupware related stuff into this
      package. Previously, groupware stuff was scattered all over application
      KDE PIM packages which resulted into complex and wrong interdependencies.
      kdepim-groupware package is self-contained dependency-wise;
    - libkontactinterfaces4 - split off this kontact interface library to the
      separate package. This allows to move kontact plugins to appropriate
      owner packages with them getting dependency on this package instead of 
      the whole 'kontact'.
  * As mentioned earlier, move akregator, kmail etc. kontact plugins to the 
    respective "owner" packages where they really belong.
  * Make kdepim-wizards strictly (=) depend on kdepim-groupware.
  * Improve some package descriptions.
  * Update install files.
  * Tweak kontact Recommends/Suggest a bit.
